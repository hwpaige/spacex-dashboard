Step 3: Enable Full USB Power (No SD Needed)
Pi 5 limits USB current by default with lower-rated supplies, which can prevent boot.

Mount the USB drive on another computer (it has two partitions: a small FAT32 "boot" or "firmware" one, and the main ext4).
Open the FAT32 partition and edit config.txt (in /boot/firmware/ for Ubuntu) with a text editor.
Add this line under [all]:
usb_max_current_enable=1

Save, eject safely, and retry booting.
Alternatively, during a failed boot, press the Pi's power button once to temporarily enable it (non-persistent).
