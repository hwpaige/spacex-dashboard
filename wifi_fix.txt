sudo nano /boot/armbianEnv.txt
Look for a line starting with overlays=. If it exists, append bananapi-m4-sdio-wifi-bt to it (space-separated, e.g., overlays=existing-overlay bananapi-m4-sdio-wifi-bt).
If no overlays= line exists, add this at the end:

overlays=bananapi-m4-sdio-wifi-bt

sudo reboot

ip link show | grep wlan
It should now show wlan0. If not, your image might lack the driverâ€”try a different Armbian build (e.g., the latest rolling release Debian Testing Minimal from armbian.com, or even a Banana Pi-provided Ubuntu image for testing, as their 5.4 kernel builds often have WiFi working out-of-box).forum.armbian.com+3 more
Step 3: Configure WiFi (No NetworkManager Needed)
Since you're on a fresh minimal/server install without internet, we'll use built-in tools like wpa_supplicant (pre-installed in Armbian) and Netplan or dhclient for IP assignment. This avoids needing to install anything.

Bring up the interface:

sudo ip link set wlan0 up


2. Disable WiFi Direct (P2P) in the Driver
This directly addresses the "Unknown Frame" warning by turning off P2P support, which isn't needed for standard WiFi.

Create a modprobe config file:
echo "options brcmfmac p2p=0" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/brcmfmac.conf

Reload the module:
textsudo modprobe -r brcmfmac
sudo modprobe brcmfmac

Reboot to apply persistently:
textsudo reboot
